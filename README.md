# RLBotOpenCV

Drives the car toward the ball while playing Rocket League.

Uses OpenCV to detect the angle of the car relative to the ball. Then, the program tries to correct for the angle deviation by pressing the keyboard keys. 

This thing is very buggy anbd limited in scope. Someday, when I learn how to implement proper control systems and advanced computer vision, I would like to rewrite this project.
